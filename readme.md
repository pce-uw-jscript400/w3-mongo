# MongoDB

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to connect to a non-relational database (MongoDB) and perform basic CRUD operations.

## Core Learning Objective

*	Interact with a document database

## Sub-Objectives

* Connect to a MongoDB database with Mongoose
* Perform basic CRUD operations on the database
* Build and run specific queries
* Validate schemas
* Model complex application ideas using embedded data models

## Installation

1. Fork & clone

1. `cp nodemon.sample.json nodemon.json`

1. Create a new Cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) titled something like `general-purpose` or reuse one you already have.

1. Update the `MONGO_DB_CONNECTION` in your `nodemon.json` file with the full connection string. Make sure you include the password you set up for the database and change the name of the database from `test` to something lke `television_characters_dev`.

1. `npm install`

1. `npm run dev`

Once installation is working, try creating and requesting resources. Note that there is currently no validation set up.

### Instructions & Guiding Questions

- [ ] Take a moment to look through the code that already exists in this repository. Run the code and test out each route, ensuring it does what you expect.

---

- [ ] We will be using both [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) and [mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) to build this project. Open up each project's documentation.

* **Question:** What is the difference between mongoose and mongodb?

* **Your Answer:** mongodb is a NoSQL, document based database system that does not rely on tables. `mongoose` is an Object-Relational Mapper or modeling tool that works well with mongodb and node.js.

---

- [ ] MongoDB uses a number of terms that may be to new to you such as database, collection, and document.

* **Question:** What is the difference between the above terms? [This page](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/) may help.

* **Your Answer:** `database` is the set of data stored in a location. Database holds the collection of documents. `collection` is the grouping of individual documents. This is similar to tables in relational database. `document` is the individual data entry in the form of javascript objects.

---

- [ ] Create a new file with the path of `api/models/series.js`. In that file, [define the schema](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#definition) for a television series. Include the fields "title", "start_year", and "season_count".

* **Question:** Where does `String` and `Number` come from?

* **Your Answer:** `String` and `Number` are global constructors that are part of javascript. They are both used to declare the type of each of the property we create inside our model.

---

- [ ] Merge the following into your schema:
  ```js
  {
    _id: Schema.Types.ObjectId
  }
  ```

* **Question:** Describe what the above code is adding to your schema.

* **Your Answer:** This line of code will add a property `_id` into our model and the value of it will be automatically generated by mongoose. It will be a unique id for each document entry.

---

- [ ] Remove the line we just added from your schema.

* **Question:** If we create a new document, will there be an ID? Why or why not?

* **Your Answer:** If we remove that from our model, mongoose will automatically generate one for each of our document for us.

---

- [ ] Add the following object as the _second argument_ to the `new Schema()` statement.
  ```js
  {
    timestamps: { createdAt: 'created_at', updatedAt: 'updated_at' }
  }
  ```

* **Question:** Describe what the above code is adding to your schema.

* **Your Answer:** We are remapping both the camelcase `createdAt` and `updatedAt` to snakecase and also adding the 2 property in our model.

---

- [ ] Import the model into your `routes/series.js` file. Use either basic promises or `async/await` to update the `GET /` method to retrieve from the database instead of the given array. [This page](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/documents.html) or [this page](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#Model) may be useful.

* **Question:** What method do you use to return all documents from a collection?

* **Your Answer:** I would use the `.find()` method to return all the documents from the collection.

---

- [ ] Update the API so that you can create documents in the database. You may either use the `<document>.save()` method or the `Model.create()` method.

* **Question:** What happens if you do not include all the fields as specified in the schema?

* **Your Answer:** If you use `Model.create()` and don't include all of the fields that are defined in the schema, the document will still be created but it will be missing the properties/fields that were not included in the request body.

---

- [ ] Take a moment to view your new document in the MongoDB Atlas console.

---

- [ ] Update the API so that you retrieve a document by ID.

* **Question:** There are a couple different ways to accomplish this goal. Which method did you choose?

* **Your Answer:** I used the `.findOne()` method passing in `{ _id: req.params.id }` as the argument.

---

- [ ] Update the API so that you are able to update a document. Use the [Model.updateOne()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.updateOne) method.

* **Question:** What are the arguments for `Model.updateOne()`?

* **Your Answer:**  The arguments for `.updateOne()` method are two objects. The first object being the id of the document you want to update. The second object being the new values/changes of the document that is being passed through the request body.

* **Question:** The response you receive is _not_ the document you updated. What information is being represented here? Try replacing `Model.updateOne()` with the [Model.findOneAndUpdate()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findOneAndUpdate) and see the difference in the result.

* **Your Answer:** The information we get when we use `.updateOne()` is meta data about the update. The difference when we use `.findOneAndUpdate()` method is that it returns the old version of the document that we just updated instead of meta data.

* **Question:** This new method will return the _old document_ instead of the new one. What option can you add to your statement to return the new one?

* **Your Answer:** We need to pass in a third argument into `.findOneAndUpdate()` with the object `{new:true}`. This will return the new updated document instead of the old document that we updated.

* **Question:** Another field was updated when you ran this command. Which one was it?

* **Your Answer:** The field/property that was also updated when we made the PUT request is the `updated_at` property.

* **Question:** Take a look at the terminal window running your server. You are likely getting the following deprecation warning:
  ```
  DeprecationWarning: Mongoose: `findOneAndUpdate()` and `findOneAndDelete()` without the `useFindAndModify` option set to false are deprecated. See: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/deprecations.html#-findandmodify-
  ```
  Take a look [at this page](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/deprecations#findandmodify) to see how to fix it. Describe the changes that took place.

* **Your Answer:** We need to add the option `useFindAndModify:false` in our mongoose connection to prevent this DeprecationWarning from happening.

---

- [ ] Update the API so that you can successfully delete a record. Use the [Model.findOneAndDelete()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findOneAndDelete) method.

---

- [ ] A lot of information is being returned on each request. Some of this information we may want to keep private. Using the [.select()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-select) method, return only the `_id`, `title`, `start_year`, and `season_count` on all the above requests.

* **Question:** At least one of these will throw an error. Which one? How can you get around this issue?

* **Your Answer:** None of the 4 properties throw an error. They are all returned. We may want to exclude some of the properties from being returned by adding the `-_id` inside the select to prevent the id field from being shown in our response.

---

- [ ] Modify your `GET /api/series` route so that you can search through the content based off of query parameters. For example, if your request was `GET /api/series?start_year=1997`, it would return all series that start in 1997.

---

- [ ] At the moment, there is no validation set on creating any series. Add validation so that each of the three fields are required in order to post to series. Handle any errors that arise with a status code 400 and a brief, standardized message.

* **Question:** You may notice that you can add custom error messages to individual fields failing. Try adding these and take a look at the error message received. How can you make use of those specific messages for each field?

* **Your Answer:** Create a middleware function that checks if any of the fields are missing in the request body. If they are output an error message that is specific to the missing field. I have added the helper middleware from the last assignment to check for the specific field that is missing in the request body. Each missing field has a unique error message that the response will display.

---

- [ ] With Mongo, it is simple to create complex data structures. Add a `characters` field to your Series model that is an array of objects. Each object should have a `name` and `image_url`. Only the `name` field on the character should be required. _Note: Don't forget to change your select statements to include the `characters` field!_

* **Question:** Take a look at the response from making a new series with a character. What field was created that you did not have to define?

* **Your Answer:** There is another `_id` field before the name of the actor. This is automatically generated by mongoose.

* **Question:** With the current routes that we have, how would you update the name of a character in a series?

* **Your Answer:** By using the same `.put` route and passing in a request body that is the same structure as our model. Inside my `.put` route, I am using the method `.findOneAndUpdate()` and passing in `{...req.body}` as my second parameter.

---

- [ ] While we can now update [subdocuments](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html), it is difficult to make changes that only relate to a single subdocument. To do so, we should make a new set of routes that relates to characters. Start by creating a `GET ALL` route for characters. The route will look something like the following and will return only the list of characters:
  ```
  GET /api/series/:seriesID/characters
  ```

* **Question:** Where did you decide to put this route and why?

* **Your Answer:** I placed it below the `GET /:id` so that this ID route can be reached before the character series ID since they both use similar url structure.

---

Spend the rest of class building out the other routes for characters. A few notes to help:

* It's worth reading the [subdocument](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html) documentation in full
* Take note of the `.id()` method for finding subdocuments by id
* Note that in order to save subdocuments, you will need to save the parent record; in our case, you should be calling `series.save()`, _not_ `character.save()`
